# Echologator
We're making an app that allows you to text with people within a set radius around you, anonymously. You could use this to easily chat with people at very populated places, like a library or dining hall on campus.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The primary goal of Echologator is to facilitate real-time chat rooms for users within a specific vicinity in order to foster collaboration and communication between people. The app leverages Bluetooth and GPS technologies to discover and connect with nearby users, promoting local interactions and community engagement.

### In-Progress Features
- **Proximity-Based Messaging**: Communicate with people in your immediate vicinity.
- **Geofencing**: Create virtual perimeters for real-world geographic areas to enhance location-based interactions.
- **Account Customization**: Choose between anonymous interactions with temporary nicknames or create a profile for more personalized communication.
- **Privacy-Focused**: The app is designed with privacy in mind, collecting minimal data and ensuring user information is protected.
- **Account Authentication**: Use external sources such as Snapchat to authenticate account.

### Technology Stack
- **Front End**: Developed using React Native with Expo, incorporating TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.
- **Back End**: Utilizes Firebase for real-time database needs and Node.js for server-side logic, also written in TypeScript.
- **Location Services**: Implements expo-location for location tracking and geofencing functionalities.

### Privacy Considerations
Echologator prioritizes user privacy by only collecting location data when the app is in use, attaching it to anonymized user IDs, and deleting user data upon disconnection.
